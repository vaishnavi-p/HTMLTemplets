Things are much fascinating and wonderful in any sense. But as humans, we have lost a lot of enthusiasm and creativity in the process of growing up. Competition,pride, praise, reward, and superiority of knowing or showing off your knowledge/intelligence have ruined to the fun of stratification of understanding the beauty of simplistic logic in which things are built. And later we crave the greediness into research papers, job hike, and fame, and money.
So quite frequently learning which is the most fun of things becomes boring and repetitive   clumsy in the way things are presented to us as a child. So it shapes us in a similar way.

But alas all of this screaming of problems with education and the fault in the system is been portrayed in a lot of essay books, memes, cartoons, and articles. So what is the point in reiterating the same complaint? Ya, that is true, nothing comes out of complaining. But we can try to think and research things which can broaden our horizon of solving the problem.  I do understand we donâ€™t have the tools or authority to pull it off. But what is harm is imagination and laying the field for people to think about. We can recursively hit each case with all possibility of loopholes which people can think of.
